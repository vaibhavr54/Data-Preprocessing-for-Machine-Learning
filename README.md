# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

A practical and focused Python toolkit to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for robust machine learning models. This repository guides you through essential preprocessing steps including data cleansing, encoding, scaling, and splitting using industry-standard Python libraries.

## Overview

This repository provides structured Jupyter notebooks and scripts designed to tackle common data preparation challenges. Follow a step-by-step workflow to convert raw data into clean, model-ready form, improving model accuracy and reliability.

## Core Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Quickly import and inspect datasets to assess quality and structure.
- **Missing Value Strategies:** Identify and impute or handle null values efficiently.
- **Data Transformation:** Techniques such as binning and formatting for numerical and categorical variables.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Convert categorical features into machine-readable numeric formats.
- **Training-Test Split:** Create unbiased datasets for model training and evaluation.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize data features for balanced model input.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
